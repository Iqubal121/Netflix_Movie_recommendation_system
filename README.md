## Overview
The movie recommendation system aims to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users. It utilizes collaborative filtering, which is a technique commonly used in recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering works by finding patterns in user behavior and leveraging those patterns to make predictions or recommendations.

## Installation
To set up the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Iqubal121/Netflix_Movie_recommendation_system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd movie-recommendation-system
Install the required dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset (see the Dataset section for more details).

Run the recommendation system:

Copy code
python recommend_movies.py
Follow the prompts to input your preferences and receive movie recommendations.
Dataset
The dataset used for this recommendation system contains movie ratings provided by users. Each entry in the dataset consists of a user ID, movie ID, and the rating assigned by the user. The dataset should be in a CSV format, with each row representing a rating.

To use your own dataset, follow these guidelines:

The dataset should be in CSV format.
The CSV file should contain three columns: user_id, movie_id, and rating.
Ensure that the dataset file is placed in the data directory of the project.
Algorithm
The movie recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering, specifically item-based collaborative filtering. In this approach, the system identifies similar movies based on the ratings provided by users. It then recommends movies that are highly rated by users who have similar preferences to the target user.

The algorithm consists of the following steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Compute the similarity between movies using a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity).
Identify the top-k similar movies for each movie.
Predict ratings for unrated movies by considering the ratings of similar movies.
Sort the predicted ratings and recommend the top-N movies to the user.
Evaluation
The performance of the recommendation system can be evaluated using various metrics, such as precision, recall, and mean average precision. These metrics assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendations provided by the system.

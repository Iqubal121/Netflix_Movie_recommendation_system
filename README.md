### Overview
The Netflix Movie Recommendation Engine uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and suggest movies that align with individual preferences. This project is designed to help users discover new movies tailored to their tastes.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

**Movie Metadata:** Information about movies, including title, genres, cast, crew, and descriptions.

**User Ratings:** Historical ratings given by users to movies.

**Viewing History:** Data reflecting users' watched movies.

The dataset can be sourced from Kaggle's Movie Dataset.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences.
2. To analyze user behavior and identify patterns in viewing habits.
3. To improve user engagement by providing personalized content recommendations.
4. Technologies Used

### Libraries Used 
1. **Python:** A programming language for developing the recommendation engine.
2. **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
3. **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
4. **Scikit-learn:** For building machine learning models.
5. **Streamlit:** For creating a web application to serve the recommendations.
6. **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.

#### Approach
The recommendation engine follows a two-pronged approach:

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes user-item interactions to find similarities between users and recommend movies based on similar users' preferences.
2. **Content-Based Filtering:** Analyzes the attributes of the movies (genres, actors, etc.) to recommend similar movies to those the user has liked in the past.

### How It Works
**Data Preprocessing: **Load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

**Model Training:** Implement collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models using user ratings and movie metadata.

**Recommendation Generation:** Based on the trained models, generate movie recommendations for users.

**Web Application:** Create a Flask web app that allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.
